### HandsOn Workshop on AI/ML for NMD students at NID Gandinagar
Related content, references, notebooks.

### Topics we would be covering
    1.  Introduction to basic programming
    2.  Introducing Jupyter.
    3.  Playing with Data. Basic functions: filtering, average, median distribution, standard deviations etc.
    4.  Plots, graphs.
    5.  Datasets, labels. Creating dataset(images, text)
    6.  Training a model.
        -   Naive Bayes model.
        -   SVM.
        -   k-means.
        -   Some more examples/algorithms.
    7.  Introduction to:
        -   clustering
        -   classification
        -   regression model
        -   recommendation system
    8.  Examples of different cases of models being used in applications. Machine translation, Speech to Text, Grammarly(?)
    9.  **Exploring Features**, it plays important role in understanding how the model behaves and answering the question: Why is my model giving me this result.
    10. Neural networks, Deep learning, RNN, CNN, BNN et all. <span class="underline">THE WHAT?</span>
    11. Examples of unsupervised learning using Deep learning and making sense out of results.
    12. Applications, Demo: Deep Fakes, Mimic Audio, Object detection, writing an article, applying filters on images([deep-dreams](https://github.com/google/deepdream)), videos.
    13. Tools available, Library, APIs.

### Terminology:
    1.  Dataset
